I tried to set up an Ubuntu 16.04 (Zenial) PC to print wirelessly to an HP LaserJet P1102w which had already been configured to join my wireless network. The printer appeared to install correctly but jobs did not print. I removed the printer then ran `sudo hp-setup` in a terminal window; this installed a plugin which fixed the problem.
